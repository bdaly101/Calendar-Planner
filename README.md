#Calendar Planner

##Description
This project is a simple calendar event tracker. The user enters tasks to do in a box for the selected day. The current day box is colored green and future day boxes are colored red while past ones are grey. The top of the page displays the current time and date. Once the user enters the task, they click he save button next to that day's box and the task is stored in the user's local storage. To create this project I used HTML for the website structure, CSS for the website design, and Javascript and JQuery for the website's functionality.
